# Dress-to-Success
My DTI blog website! Its my first time using html css and javascript and I hope you enjoy!

pages----------------
So far I have three pages: a home page, a secret code page, and a hall of fame outfits page. In my home page, I have a description of my bio and why I made this website. It is essentially for expressing my love and interest in this game, and to also expand my web development skills. This project has definitely taught me a lot. For the secret codes page, I gathered all the DTI codes you can insert into the game for users to have a fun, interactive code reference page they can use, in order to put in the codes and have more items in the game. At the bottom, there is a likes and dislikes section, where users can easily access which codes they want and do not want. The last page is my own outfit hall of fame, where I have pictures of my past creations and a rating system similar to DTI, in order to engage users.


style----------------
The styling of these pages uses the grid and flex formulas in css. This is why there is one element per column, and I wanted my hall of fame elements to look like photocards. I used the Audiowide and Indie Flower fonts from google. There are a mix of my own images and images online that I used for this project. I have one style css file.

javascript-----------
I wanted to add interactive compenents to the project, such as interactive rating buttons to look like the star rating system in DTI, as well as a likes and dislikes section in the secret codes page for users to easily navigate which codes they prefer to type in and receive. I have two javascript files, one for my secret codes page adn the other for my outfit hall of fame page.
